This is a sample file for testing the AWS Transfer Family SFTP service and Lambda decryption function.

When you upload this file to the SFTP server, the following should happen:
1. File is stored in the S3 bucket
2. EventBridge rule detects the upload
3. Lambda function is triggered
4. Lambda function "decrypts" this file (mock implementation)
5. Decrypted file is stored in the S3 bucket under the "decrypted/" prefix

To use this file:
1. Connect to your SFTP server using your SSH key
2. Upload this file
3. Check the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console
4. Verify that a decrypted version appears in the decrypted/ prefix

If you'd like to test with a realistic encrypted file, you can encrypt this 
file using gpg or another encryption tool before uploading it to the SFTP server.

For example:
```
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 sample-file.txt
```

Then upload the resulting sample-file.txt.gpg file to the SFTP server.
In a real implementation, the Lambda function would have the necessary
decryption keys to process the file.
